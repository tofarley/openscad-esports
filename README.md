This is a collection of models from Too Tall Toby's challenges, created in OpenSCAD.


## Calculating mass.

OpenSCAD lacks the ability to calculate mass, so I forked a great little python script that can calculate the mass of stl files.

The original project is here:
[mcanet/STL-Volume-Model-Calculator](https://github.com/mcanet/STL-Volume-Model-Calculator)

My fork aims to simplify the command line options, defaulting to the common TTT options, and makes minor adjustments to the material densities to support TTT.
